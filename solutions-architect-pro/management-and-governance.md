# Management and Governance

## Service Catalog
Managed service allowing users to deploy predefined workloads from a product catalog. 

- uses cloudformation templates
- integrates with ITSM systems (service now, Jira service desk, AWS Config)
- AppRegistry allows devs to deploy pre-built applications
- Manage license overrages with Cloudwatch > Step functions (not lambda) > dynamoDB > AWS License Manager

Cost
- Free tier (up to 1000 API calls)
- $0.0007 (14 calls for 1 cent) - us-east-1 & 2

## Cloudtrail
- Audit trail of all changes made to infra and environment via API calls
- Supports logging on multiple regions with the `is-multi-region-trail` option from CLI. 
- Need to enable global for global services like `IAM`, `Cloudfront`, etc with `include-global-service-events` option
- sends to S3, Cloudwatch logs, or Cloudwatch Insights
- stores past 90 days worth of logs in the console or CLI, use S3 to search events past 90 days
- `Organization trail` is set at organization level in the management account, and creates a trail that logs for all accounts and optionally, across all regions. 
- setting single-region trails requires CLI 
- log delivered within 15 mins of API call. Also see [SLA](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/sla/)
- logs encrypted by default using SSE-S3 and can be customized using SSE-KMS

Cloudwatch logs:
- send trail to cloudwatch logs, and configure cloudwatch events for specific events
- use SNS to notify of specific events and take action on it using Cloudwatch events, or AWS Systems Manager automation documents. 
- Trail for all regions sends to single cloudwatch log group ‚ùó

CloudTrail Lake:
- Use Sql-based queries to search trail logs
- stored for 7 years
- auditing solution


## Systems Manager: Patch manager

- Uses patch baseline (windows/linux/mac, when to apply, exceptions, patch source, auto-approve releases after configurable delay)
- auto-approving patches within days of their release
- whitelist/blacklist patches
- maintenance windows
- hybrid environments (cloud/on-prem)
- tag-based filtering (apply patches based on tags)

Patch groups: 
- groupings of instances to which to apply a patch baseline. Can create multiple, by environment for ex (Dev, QA, Prod)
- Requires a `tag` when creating. `key name is case-sensitive`. The tag is case-sensitive
- Add tag group in the Patch baseline section. Edit tag baseline patch group. 
- add `Patch Group` tag to instances. case sensitive! 

Maintenance Windows: 
- Set schedules for maintenance
- Supports maintenance tasks on other AWS resources like S3 buckets, SQS queues, KMS keys, etc. 
- has a schedule, a max duration, a set of registered targets

## Systems Manager: Session Manager
- connect to EC2 instances in cloud with session manager (needs instance profiles - roles)
    - role needs `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy
    - prerequisites: 
        - https outbound to ssm, ec2
    - add security group to ENI's
    - add [VPC endpoint to SSM](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-systems-manager-vpc-endpoints/)
- connect to onprem VM's using `hybrid activation`
    - IAM service role associated with the hybrid activation used to register your on-permises servers
    > ‚ùóYou can't change the IAM service role associated with a hybrid activation. If you find that the service role does not contain the required permissions, you must deregister the managed instance and register it with a new hybrid activation that uses a service role with the required permissions
- Get security credentials (`access key`, `secret access key`, `sessionKey`) from instance `meta-data` using the CLI command: 
```sh
# get from instance profile
TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \
&& curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/

# get from instance role name
TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \
&& curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<instance-role-name>
```


## AWS Config
- Set rules to monitor. Config will alert w option to auto-remediate with systems manager documents integration. 
- Use [AWS Managed rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html), or [custom rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_develop-rules.html) (requires lambda function)
- monitor and record state (previous versions) in your environment
- supports Multi-account, **multi-region** (global) data aggregation


## Event Bridge
- serverless event bus
- make rules, define source, handler and targets (functions, sns topics)

## Elastic Beanstalk
- simple application provisioning/management service
- create environments
- deployment strategies:
  - `All-at-Once`: (in-place) overwrite existing infra
  - `Rolling`: Splits the instances into batches and deploys to one batch at a time
  - Rolling with Additional Batch: Splits the deployments into batches but for the first batch creates new EC2 instances instead of deploying on the existing EC2 instances. 
  - Immutable: (Blue/green) If you need to deploy with a new instance instead of using an existing instance.
  - Traffic Splitting: (Canary) Performs immutable deployment and then forwards percentage of traffic to the new instances for a pre-determined duration of time. If the instances stay healthy, then forward all traffic to new instances and shut down old instances.

|Model | Approach | Speed | Impact
|---|---|---|---|
All at once | Overwrite each instance w new version | ‚ö° | small downtime
Rolling | deployed one batch of instances at a time | üê¢ | no downtime
Rolling with additional batch | maintain the same bandwidth throughout the deployment. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk launches an extra batch of instances, then performs a rolling deployment. | üê¢üê¢ | no downtime
Immutable | blue/green. quick and safe rollback for failures | ‚ö°| no downtime
Traffic splitting| canary. test portion of incoming traffic while keeping the rest of the traffic served by the old application version. | ‚ö°| possible small impact if new version is bad
